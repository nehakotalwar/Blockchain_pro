## About Project 
I'm Creating project for solidity Aka Metacrafters in which I've used solidity language to create a token .

# About The code
I have created my own token named "car" abbreviated as "bike". There is the record of its total supply. And if someone mints some "car" tokens then it will be added to the total supply of it. Also same goes to burn token it will subtract it.

## Remix Ide Compiler 

* I use the Online Remix IDE for implementation of  the solidity code.
* Then I created a file in this repository named NEHA.sol.

## Functions
* Create a new folder 
* If Remix is set to auto compile and run, the code will be automatically compiled and executed.
* After compiling, deploy the contract to get the account address for next steps.
* Initially, the account balance is zero.
* To mint tokens, click on the "Mint" button, paste the account address, enter the desired token quantity (Let's take a value as a e.g., 500), and click "Transact" to add tokens to the account.
* To check the balance, click on "Balances," paste the account address, and click "Call" to view the account balance.
* to check the totalsupply click on it.
* To burn tokens, click on "Burn", paste the account address, set the value to be burnt (Let's take a value as a e.g., 300), and click "Transact" to reduce tokens from the account.
* To check the balance again, press "Call" to obtain the balance. 
* These are all the steps in the contract.
